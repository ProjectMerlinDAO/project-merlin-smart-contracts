# 🎯 Lottery Presale System - Implementation Summary

## ✅ What We Built

You requested a **lottery/draw-based presale** where:
- Multiple users participate by paying USDC
- Admin selects winners after a time period
- Winners get tokens, losers get refunds
- Time-based duration for presales

## 🚀 Features Delivered

### 1. **Dual Mode Presale Contract**
- **Regular Mode**: Direct token purchase (like original TokenPresale)
- **Lottery Mode**: Draw-based with winner selection

### 2. **Time-Based Duration** ⏰
- Admin sets duration when creating presale (e.g., 3 days, 7 days)
- Automatic end time calculation
- Users can't participate after time expires
- Admin can end early if needed

### 3. **Your Exact Scenario** 🎲
```solidity
// 3 users participate in lottery
User A: Contributes 100 USDC
User B: Contributes 50 USDC  
User C: Contributes 50 USDC
Total Pool: 200 USDC = 2000 tokens (at 0.1 USDC/token)

// Admin selects User A and User B as winners
Winners get: 1000 tokens each (2000 ÷ 2)
User C gets: 50 USDC refund
```

### 4. **Progressive Token Unlocking** 🔒
- Admin controls unlock percentages (0% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
- Winners claim tokens progressively
- Same anti-double-claim protection as original

### 5. **Comprehensive Status Tracking** 📊
- Users can see: tokens bought, unlocked, claimed, locked, claimable
- Lottery-specific: winner status, refund amounts
- Real-time participation tracking
